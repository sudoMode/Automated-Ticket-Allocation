# Capstone_Project
NLP Capstone project

# Objective:
1.To undertake a multi-faceted project that demonstrates your understanding and mastery of the key conceptual and technological aspects of Deep Learning.

2.To develop an understanding of how challenging human-level problems can be approached and solved using a combination of tools and techniques.

3.To understand current scenarios in deep learning, understand the practicalities and the trade-offs that need to be made when solving a problem in real life.Milestones:

This project has 2 milestones. You get 3 weeks for completing each milestone. 

The 1st milestone should be submitted as part of the interim report.

# 1st Milestone:

 1.Problem interpretation

    a.Understand the data
    b.Make an abstract or an overview based on your approach
    c.Break the problem into smaller tasksï‚·Discuss among your teammates and share responsibilities

 2.Data analysis and preprocessing: 

 Visual displays are powerful when used well, so think carefully about the information the display.Include any insightful visualization   Share and explain particularly meaningful features, interactions or summary of data
        
       a. Display examples to input in your model
        
       b. Explain changes to be incorporated into data so that it becomes ready for the model
        
3.Modeling What kind of neural network you have used and why?
        
        a. What progress you have made towards your intended solution?
        
# 2nd Milestone

4.Model evaluation
  
  Describe how you will proceed with the analysis
  
          a.Compare different models and choose which model to use 
          
          b.Do hyper-parameter tuning of your mode
          
          c.How will you build on your initial analysis to increase the accuracy of your model
          
5.Presentation and Report
  
          a.You should start preparing the final report at least 2 weeks prior to the project completion date.
          
          b.Teams should send a draft Last of the project before the last session to the mentor and get the necessary inputs for submission.
          c.The expectations for the final report will be included in your Capstone course
